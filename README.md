Elastomers in  a Hydrogen Environment - BP America

Our Team's capstone's project investigated the degradation of elastomers in hydrogen-rich environments, which is a major concern for hydrogen processing facilities due to the risk of seal failure, hydrogen leakage, and safety hazards. We designed and validated a 3D-printed permeation cell to measure hydrogen permeation through elastomer O-rings and exposed Viton samples to high-pressure hydrogen gas mixture (98% H₂, 1.5% N₂, 0.5% CH₄) exposure at 100°C and 100 bar for 56 hours. Post-aging tensile testing confirmed hydrogen-induced material degradation.  These findings support further research into developing more resilient elastomers and estimating service life in hydrogen applications.
